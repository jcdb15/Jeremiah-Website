								<h2>WHO I'M?<br /></h2>
							</header>
							<p>I’m originally from Tacloban City, a place I’ve always called home and where my journey began. However, I made the decision to transfer to Sorsogon, specifically to Bulan, to take a significant step towards pursuing my dreams and building my career. At 22 years old, I am driven by a clear vision of my future, which involves becoming a professional programmer or designer—a career path that excites me and aligns with my passion for technology and creativity.

								Before I can achieve those goals, I am deeply committed to completing my studies and earning my degree. I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a field that provides the foundation I need to develop the skills and knowledge required for my aspirations. Studying in Bulan, Sorsogon, has been an enriching experience, and I am motivated to excel in my academics, knowing that each step brings me closer to turning my dreams into reality.</p>

						<h2>Hobbies and Interest</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Activities or pursuits that individuals engage in during their leisure time to relax, have fun, or develop skills. Hobbies often involve creative, physical, or intellectual engagement, such as painting, sports, or reading. Interests, on the other hand, represent areas of curiosity or passion, like technology, history, or fashion, which may not necessarily involve direct participation. Together, they reflect personal preferences and contribute to self-expression, skill development, and overall well-being.</p>

							<h3>Video Editor </h3>
							<p>I enjoy video editing because it allows me to creatively express myself while working with visuals and sounds to tell a story or convey a message. The process of piecing together clips, adding effects, and synchronizing audio feels incredibly satisfying, especially when the final product turns out exactly as I envisioned. It's a rewarding activity that gives me a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment.</p>

							<h3>Listining Music</h3>
							<p>Wherever I go, I always find myself listening to music because it brings me comfort and joy. Music has a unique ability to resonate with my emotions, and it helps me escape from the stresses of everyday life or any sense of boredom. Whether I’m feeling overwhelmed or just need a break, listening to my favorite songs allows me to relax, reflect, and recharge. I enjoy vibing to the rhythm and lyrics, as they often uplift my mood and create a sense of peace. Music becomes my companion, turning even mundane moments into something meaningful and enjoyable. It’s not just a pastime but a way to connect with myself and the world around me. </p>

							<h3>UI/UX Designer</h3>
							<p>My interest in UI/UX design stems from my passion for creating user-centered solutions that blend functionality with aesthetics. I am fascinated by the process of understanding user needs, solving problems, and designing interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and easy to use. The dynamic nature of UI/UX design, which involves research, creativity, and innovation, motivates me to continuously learn and improve. I love the idea of making technology more accessible and enjoyable for people, ensuring that every interaction leaves a positive impression.</p>
